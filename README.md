# Intro to webdev!

For this session you will need to boot into ubuntu. Restart your PC and select Ubuntu 14 from the startup menu!

### Installing a webserver

It is simple to install a web server on a linux machine. [This DO tutorial goes over getting apache2 installed and setup with PHP](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-lamp-on-ubuntu-14-04-quickstart). Once you have finished that you can visit your [http://localhost/](http://localhost/) and verify it is working!

### Install PHPMyAdmin

PHPMyAdmin is a web based tool that lets you interact with your database (This will be useful later on). [Once again there is a DO tutorial for this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-phpmyadmin-on-ubuntu-14-04), and you only need to do step one to get things running.

#### Making a simple blog

Now we have a development envorment we are now going to make a simple blog! [Once again we have a tutorial](http://programanddesign.com/php/create-a-blog-in-30-minutes-without-a-framework/), if you dont know PHP feel free to go through this totorial as it does a great job of explaining how everything works. If you do already know PHP feel free to download the pre-made blog from the bottom!

### Extra stuff!

From here on feel free to play with the blog system, style it, add comments, whatever you can!

### A little about how domain names work

We will maybe do another session on this, but if your interested! https://howdns.works
